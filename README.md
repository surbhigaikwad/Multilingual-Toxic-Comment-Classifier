# Multilingual Toxic Comment Classifier

## Overview

This project involves building a **multilingual toxic comment classification model** using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify comments as **toxic** or **non-toxic** in multiple languages. It utilizes the **Jigsaw Multilingual Toxic Comment Classification dataset** and is designed to process toxic comments in various languages using state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models such as **DistilBERT**.

The model is trained to detect **hate speech**, **harassment**, and **abusive content**, making it a useful tool for **content moderation** in multilingual environments.
